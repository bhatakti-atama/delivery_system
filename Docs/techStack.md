# Tech-stack plan and reasoning

## Backened :

### Django
- I have past expereince with python
- Better for handling data
- Better performance due to inbuilt templates 
- More secure than node js
- Less development time

### Mysql 
- The data is quite strutured so mysql is a better choice

## Frontend :

### Other frameworks will be used if need arises
